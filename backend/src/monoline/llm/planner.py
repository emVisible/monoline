"""V29: a local model upgrades only the beats the rules could not do anything with.

Why not "the LLM plans everything" — measured on the local 7.5B q4 model:
a full-plan request cost 83s, returned 5 items for 6 beats (breaking the
1 beat = 1 scene invariant), reshaped slots (`stat` came back as `{"stat":[…]}`),
and still classified an arrow chain and a "分为四层" enumeration as plain `list` —
which the rule planner now renders as real flow / radial diagrams. So the rules own
the structure and the model is asked only about beats that would otherwise be one
line of text, and its answer is dropped unless it is well-formed and grounded.
