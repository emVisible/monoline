"""V48: the single contract for text that gets DISPLAYED on a slide.

Before this, punctuation rules lived in 11 separate regexes/`strip` calls inside
`pipeline/planner.py` (+ `segment.py`, + two audio-only dedupe rules in `narration.py`
that no display path ever imported), and templates/CSS had none. Measured on the real
corpus (43 jobs / 311 beats): 43 display strings (13.8%) ended in punctuation, 17 (5.5%)
ended mid-clause on 「，、：」, and 4 had a quote mark with no partner because the pair
was split across two beats.

The rule we implement is GB/T 15834-2011 附录 B.4: a title/heading carries no terminal
punctuation — except ？, ！ and …, which are part of the wording, not a sentence marker.
W3C clreq adds that a display line must not open with punctuation either. Everything here
is that narrow: we never rewrite wording, we only drop marks that carry no meaning at the
end of a display line, and we drop quote marks that were orphaned by segmentation.

Applied at the two places that GENERATE text (RulePlanner.plan, llm.planner.merge). Not on
the manual PATCH path: a slot the user typed by hand is what they asked for, and silently
eating a character they typed is a worse surprise than the mark itself.
