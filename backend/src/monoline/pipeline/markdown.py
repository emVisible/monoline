"""Markdown → the lines the beat model reads. One owner, parser-driven.

The IR guarantees 1 beat = 1 segment = 1 scene (the audio is cut from the beat), so the
question this module answers is not "how do I render markdown" but "what IS one beat" when the
input is markdown. Answer, per CommonMark: **one block-level statement**. A paragraph that a
LLM or a README hard-wrapped across three source lines is ONE sentence, not three; a table is
ONE row-set; a thematic break is nothing at all.

Measured on a torture document before this existed (20 beats out of 9 blocks): a wrapped
paragraph arrived as three half-sentences, `> ` and `[ ]` and `~~` and `` ``` `` leaked into the
slide text, a code fence became three beats and welded the following setext heading onto one of
them, and a footnote reference `[^1]` was promoted to a giant `stat` because it contains a
digit. All of those are the same root cause: the segmenter was reading SOURCE lines instead of
BLOCKS.

So: parse with markdown-it (never regexes over raw lines — `---` under a paragraph is a setext
heading and a `|` inside a paragraph is not a table), then emit one plain-text line per block,
keeping the `#` / `-` markers the segmenter uses to recognise a deliberate short line.
