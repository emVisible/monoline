"""Segmentation strategy — turn arbitrary pasted text into well-sized beats.

The M1 failure was "one line = one beat": a pasted paragraph became a single
37s wall-of-text caption. This splits into sentence-level beats with a length
budget, while RESPECTING the user's explicit line breaks as strong boundaries.

Pluggable: `Segmenter` protocol; `SentenceSegmenter` is the v1 (only) impl.
LLM semantic segmentation can drop in later behind the same interface.

    (llm.planner.upgrade) so a small local model never receives the whole thing at once.

    at 248 beats and hit the old 240 ceiling, i.e. the guard rejected the exact input this
    tool exists for. 1200 beats ≈ 33k characters ≈ 52 minutes of narration — past that the
    paste is a manuscript, and a job that long would fail in render (frame count, disk)
    rather than here, which is the wrong place to discover it.

    `hard_cap=None` removes the guard. The preview endpoint counts with it off: it has to
    report the number a manuscript-sized paste *would* produce in order to warn about it,
